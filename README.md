# Long-read_Metagenomics_training_Jan2026
This repository is dedicated for the **Long-read metagenomics analysis for human gut microbiome** workshop held at the Oxford Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) Hanoi from January 12, 2026 to January 17, 2026.

Since this is a private workshop, the reads will only be accessible once they are submitted to public archive. If you did not attend the workshop and wish to follow the steps, any human gut microbiome metagenomes from public archive should work. 

Please visit this repository's wiki for workshop's schedule, OS/hardware and software requirements, and detailed analysis steps.
